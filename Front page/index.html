Padma Multipurpose Bridge is considered to be the most challenging construction project in the history of Bangladesh. The two-level steel truss bridge carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single track railway on a lower level.[4] The bridge with 150.12 m (492.5 ft) long 41 spans, 6.150 km (3.821 mi) total length[3] and 22.5 m (74 ft) width,[5] is the longest bridge in Bangladesh, and the longest over Ganges in terms of both span and the total length.</p>

His successor, Shaista Khan, did not continue the work, though he stayed in Dhaka up to 1688.

                        The fort was never completed, and unoccupied for a long period of time. Much of the complex was built over and now sits across from modern buildings.</p>
